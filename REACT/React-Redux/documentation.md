# Why Use React-Redux?

React-Redux serves as the official library for connecting Redux with React. Here are key reasons developers use it:

- **Simplifies State Management**  
  Provides a structured approach to handle state changes in one centralized location.

- **Predictable State Flow**  
  State changes only occur through defined actions processed by reducers, ensuring transparent data flow.

- **Decouples Components**  
  Separates UI components from state logic (components handle rendering, Redux manages state).

- **Easier Debugging**  
  Integrates with Redux DevTools for state inspection, logging, and time-travel debugging.

- **Performance Optimizations**  
  Uses shallow equality checks to prevent unnecessary component re-renders.

# Core Concepts of React-Redux

## 1. Store
Centralized object holding the application state. The only source of truth for state changes.

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

## 2. Actions
Plain JavaScript objects describing state changes. Must contain a `type` property.

```javascript
const incrementAction = {
    type: 'INCREMENT',
    payload: 1
};
```

## 3. Reducers
Pure functions that handle state transformations based on action types.

```javascript
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return state + action.payload;
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return state - action.payload;
        default:
            return state;
    }
};
```

## 4. Dispatch
Method for sending actions to the store to trigger state changes.

```javascript
store.dispatch(incrementAction);
```

## 5. Selectors
Functions that extract specific state slices from the store.

```javascript
const selectCount = (state) => state.count;
```

## 6. Provider
Wrapper component that makes the Redux store available throughout the app.

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

<Provider store={store}>
    <App />
</Provider>
```

## 7. connect()
Higher-order component for connecting React components to the Redux store.

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const Counter = ({ count, increment }) => (
    <div>
        <h1>{count}</h1>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    count: state.count
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 })
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

> **Note:** Modern React-Redux recommends using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks over `connect()` for functional components.

# How React-Redux Works

React-Redux connects React components to the Redux store for streamlined state management. Here's the workflow:

## 1. Setting Up the Store
The Redux store acts as the single source of truth for application state.

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(counterReducer);
```

## 2. Dispatching Actions
Actions trigger state changes through explicit event descriptions.

```javascript
// Action object format
store.dispatch({ 
    type: 'INCREMENT',
    payload: 1 
});
```

## 3. Reducers Update the State
Pure functions handle state transformations based on action types.

```javascript
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT': 
            return state + action.payload;
        default: 
            return state;
    }
};
```

## 4. Connecting Components
`connect()` links components to the Redux store for state/action access.

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({ count: state });
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 })
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(CounterComponent);
```

## 5. Provider Component
Makes the store globally accessible to nested components.

```jsx
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

<Provider store={store}>
    <App />
</Provider>
```

## 6. Optimized Re-Renders
React-Redux implements smart rendering through:
- Shallow equality checks for state changes
- Selective component updates
- Memoization techniques
- Minimal re-render cascades

**Key Flow:**  
`Action → Reducer → Store Update → Selective Component Re-render`
